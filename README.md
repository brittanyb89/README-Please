## Description

Developer created this project to demonstrate abilities to create a professional README file using Nodejs. This project was built to display another way of creating a README file quickly without having to enter it by typing into a file. Rather, this technique would allow the user to enter their information into the terminal and create the README that can be viewed inside the browser for new projects. In creating this project, I learned the useful ways of using Node to create a README file generator.
